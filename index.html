            <p><strong>1. Deck & Cards</strong><br>
                The game is played with 2 standard decks of 52 cards each. The objective is to form valid sets and sequences.</p>
    
            <p><strong>2. Dealing</strong><br>

            <p><strong>3. Forming Sets & Sequences</strong><br>
                Players must create a valid combination of pure sequences and sets. A pure sequence is mandatory to declare a win.</p>

                Players pick one card from the draw pile and discard one to maintain 13 cards.</p>

            <h2>Tips to Win Rummy 420</h2>
            <p>To increase your chances of winning in Rummy 420, consider the following tips:</p>
        
            <p><strong>1. Arrange Your Cards Properly</strong><br>
                Sort your cards into potential sequences and sets to avoid confusion during gameplay.</p>
        
            <p><strong>2. Prioritize a Pure Sequence</strong><br>
                Without a pure sequence, you cannot declare a win. Focus on forming one as early as possible.</p>
        
            <p><strong>3. Discard High-Value Cards</strong><br>
                If your opponent declares before you, holding high-value cards can result in a higher loss. Discard them early unless they fit into a sequence.</p>
        
            <p><strong>4. Observe Your Opponent</strong><br>
                Keep an eye on the cards your opponent picks or discards. This helps in predicting their strategy.</p>
    
            <p><strong>5. Use Jokers Wisely</strong><br>
                Wildcards and jokers are crucial for forming sets and sequences. Use them strategically to complete your hand.</p>
